# product-images-not-showing

WooCommerce POS uses the same thumbnail sizes as WooCommerce, these can found in WP Admin &gt; WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Products.

Thumbnails are created when you upload the product image to WordPress. If you have changed the thumbnail size after uploading the product image you may need to [regenerate your thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).
