If you are having problems saving your POS Settings it could mean your server does not support modern HTTP methods. 
This can be fixed by going to `WP Admin > POS > Settings > Tools > Enable legacy server support`.
Please see the [Legacy Server document](http://docs.wcpos.com/en/support/legacy-servers.html) for more information.
