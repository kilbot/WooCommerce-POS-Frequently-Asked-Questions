WooCommerce POS uses the same thumbnail sizes as WooCommerce, these can found under the Products tab in your WooCommerce Settings (ie: http://_yourshop.com_/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=products). 

Thumbnails are created when you upload the product image to WordPress. If you have changed the thumbnail size after uploading the product image you may need to [regenerate your thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).
