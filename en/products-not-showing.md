When setting up WooCommerce POS for the first time it is possible that you run into an error loading the products. If you are experiencing an issue like this - **your first stop should always be the support page**. There is a link to the support page in the menu, top left on the POS screen. 

![Links to the Support Page in WooCommerce POS](https://wcpos.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/support-screen.png "How to find the Support Page in WooCommerce POS")

On the support page you will see a POS system status report. This will contain tests for the most common problems. If one of the tests fails you will see a red cross on the status report. Please follow the instructions given until you see all green ticks.
