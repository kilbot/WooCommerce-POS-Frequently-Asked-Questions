Any barcode scanner should work with WooCommerce POS, scanners simply output the serial number to the computer just like a (really fast) keyboard. For more information about how to set and search barcodes in WooCommerce POS, please read the [Barcode Scanning documentation](http://wcpos.com/docs/barcode-scanning/). 

Version 0.4 of WooCommerce POS will support hotkeys - this means that if you set a custom prefix on the barcode scanner the POS will automatically know you are scanning a product without having to manually focus on the search field. For this functionality to work you may need a scanner that supports 'custom prefixes'. 

For a good general purpose barcode scanner that works well with most devices we recommend the [TaoTronics TT-BS016 Bluetooth Wireless Barcode Scanner](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=0N6-0004-00014). However, you should read the capabilities to make sure this scanner is suitable for your requirements.
