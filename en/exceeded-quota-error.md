title: Why am I getting an Exceeded Quota Error?
description: This error usually appears when there is no more disk space on your local machine.
---

WooCommerce POS stores data in your browser, for example, _products_, _customers_ and _orders_. 
Each browser will have a limit or quota for how much data can be stored locally. 
The quota will vary for each machine, but in general the limit will depend on the available disk space.

If you are seeing an Exceeded Quota Error, please check the available disk space on your device. 
Clearing some room should fix the problem. 
The amount of disk space you require will depend on your store, but it should be in the order of megabytes not gigabytes.
