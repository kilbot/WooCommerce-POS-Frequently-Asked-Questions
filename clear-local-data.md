WooCommerce POS stores data locally (eg: a copy of your products), this improves performance and will also allow offline sales in a future version of WooCommerce POS. From time to time it may be necessary to clear the local data and retrieve fresh data from your web server. 

To clear the local data, please go to your POS Support page.

### indexedDB errors

If you are experiencing POS errors you may need to completely clear all local data, this can be done using the Clear Browser Data option in your browser preferences.
